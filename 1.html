        Cause loving nobody, is breaking my heart but you'll never know this, wherever you are. 

        <br>Well maybe I don't give up easily but <strong>I know this is <u>hard</u> to see.</strong>

        And I wish time would slow down. So I could keep your heart around. 
        If I can't make you stay another day, I'll wait another day for you. For you.

        But I know time won't slow down. So I can't keep your heart in my hand but maybe if you stay a little while. 
        You might feel like I do.
